# Python from Zero to AI - A Developer's Journey  
This repository is a step-by-step journey of learning Python from scratch, tailored for a seasoned developer with 9 years of experience in web development, backend systems, microservices, and design patterns, as well as expertise in Azure Cloud. With a focus on building a solid foundation in Python, this project is dedicated to exploring its applications in artificial intelligence (AI). Follow along as I document my progress, insights, and practical examples, moving from Python basics to advanced concepts in AI development.


### **Day-by-Day Python Learning Path for AI**  

This plan spans **30 days**, dedicating 2 hours daily, progressing from Python fundamentals to AI-specific topics.

### **Week 1: Python Basics (Foundation)**  
**Day 1**:  
- Install Python and set up IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter).  
- Write your first program: `Hello, World!`.  
- Understand Python syntax, indentation, and comments.  

**Day 2**:  
- Variables and data types (int, float, string, boolean).  
- Input and output functions.  
- Practice basic arithmetic operations.  

**Day 3**:  
- Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`.  
- Loops: `for` and `while`.  
- Practice writing simple conditional and iterative programs.  

**Day 4**:  
- Lists, tuples, and sets: Creation, indexing, slicing, and methods.  
- Practice operations on these data structures.  

**Day 5**:  
- Dictionaries: Keys, values, and common operations.  
- Learn list comprehensions for concise code.  

**Day 6**:  
- Functions: Define and call functions, arguments, and return values.  
- Explore built-in functions like `len()`, `sum()`, and `map()`.  

**Day 7**:  
- Error handling: Try-except blocks.  
- Practice debugging simple programs.  
- **Project**: Create a basic calculator app.

**Day 11**:  
- Modules and packages: Learn `import`, built-in modules (`math`, `os`).  
- Explore `pip` to install third-party libraries.  

**Day 12**:  
- Practice regular expressions using the `re` module.  
- Explore string formatting and manipulation techniques.  

**Day 13**:  
- Explore Pythonâ€™s standard libraries (`datetime`, `random`).  
- Learn how to write modular and reusable code.  

**Day 14**:  
- **Project**: Create a simple file organizer script using file handling and OOP.
